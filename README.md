# How Greenspace Makes the Green

### Group Members: Andrew Hill, Rohun Iyer, Angel Liu, Sarah Sachs
This repository contains code and data for our final Applied Data Science (Fall 2018) project.

### Proposal
We will utilize New York Cityâ€™s park zones data to attempt to identify a relationship with rental price data from Zillow. Our goal is to see if there is an effect on property value when there is green space nearby. Furthermore, we will control for the park zone propensity to contribute to value by including different value drivers: WiFi,  dog parks, number of trees within park boundaries. Other controls in our model include the median property value of the neighborhood, housing descriptors. 

The question at hand: How does proximity to park affect property value?

Null Hypothesis - Proximity to green spaces has no effect or a negative effect on the Rental Price of houses
 
Alternative Hypothesis - Proximity to green spaces has a positive effect on the Rental Price of houses
